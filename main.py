#  350 how websites work

# websites consist of 3 types of files

# html are responsible for the structure (add image, add buttons and so on)
# css are used for styling/appearence the website
# javascript gives the behaviour

# 352 + 353 HTML = hypertext markup language

# we can use https://codepen.io --> start coding --> change view --> third

# Let us enter
# The adventures of Sherlock Holmes
# by
# Sir Arthur Conan Doyle

# html consist of two parts: <HTML element HTML attribute>
# First is what we want and second is how we want to modify it
# comments are made using <!--COMMENT -->

# We can change the heading using <h1> in front. Also remember we have to end it using </h1>. These are called
# These are called start and end tag
# We can make Sir Arthur Conan Doyle smaller than the title using h2 and h2 for by
# The headings only goes to h6
# Creating space can be done using a line break <br>. We do not have to close these (=called self-closing tags)
# we can create horizontal lines above and below our text with a given size using <hr size="3"> (self-closing)
# lastly we can center it at the beginning and end using <center>

# So our code becomes
# <center>
# <hr size="3">
# <h1> The adventures of Sherlock Holmes</h1>
# <br>
# <h3>by</h3>
# <br>
# <h2> Sir Arthur Conan Doyle</h2>
# We can check documentations using devdocs.io
# <hr size="3">
# </center>

# 355 HTML boilerplate. We will continue in Personal Site.html.
# Here we get a template called a boilerplate

### 359 anchor tags ##

# To make a like reference, we use the anchor tag
# <a href = "LINK DISTINATION" > Link text </a>
# The link is blue if we haven't clicked on it and purple if we've already clicked it.
# To create a separate page, we can inside the html folder we can right click and create a new file
# we then create a new anchor tag and the href will be the ref to this new file

# 368 publish webpage on the internet. For this we use GitHub
# we use kimp4213@gmail.com and password kimphan95
