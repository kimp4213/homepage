        <!-- # 361 html tables - we want to make a table of what we've done and when we've done it. We here use tables
         and top row tr to create two date elements. To represent the cells we use table data td elements
         To create headers, body and footer and so on, we can use table head (th), tbody and tfoot and these are bold
         To create outlines to the tables, we write border inside table.
         362 - tables for layout We can create spacing between cells using cellspacing so e.g. <table cellspacing="2">
